🏏 Cricket Live Win Predictor

This project is a real-time win probability predictor for IPL matches using machine learning. It helps users predict the chances of each team winning based on live match inputs like score, overs, and wickets.

Basically, this is a group project built during my B.Tech studies. The goal was to create a web-based win probability predictor for IPL matches using machine learning.

🧠 My Contributions

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand match patterns
Engineered meaningful features to improve model accuracy
Helped in model selection using Logistic Regression
Supported integration with Streamlit for web app deployment




🔍 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model and a web app that:
Predicts the win probability of IPL teams in real time
Supports fans, analysts, and cricket strategists with quick insights


⚙️ How It Works

User Inputs:
Batting Team
Bowling Team
Match City
Target Score
Current Score
Overs & Wickets

Click "Predict Probability"
The app instantly shows win chances (%) for both teams.


🧠 Technologies Used

Python
Streamlit (Web App)
Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
Scikit-learn (ML Models)
Logistic Regression (Model used)


💡 Key Features
Real-time prediction
Simple user interface
lightweight and fast
Helps in decision-making during live matches


📊 Results

Achieved 82% accuracy in predicting outcomes on test data
Web app gives instant win prediction during a live match


🚀 Future Scope

Add live API integration for automatic input
Include more match factors (like pitch, player form, etc.)
Extend to other formats like ODI or T20 leagues
